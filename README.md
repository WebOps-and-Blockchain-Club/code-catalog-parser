# Project Setup Instructions

This Python script extracts and parses Python source code from github repo URL. It organizes class and function information, generating an output file (output.txt).

## Setup Instructions

1. **In `index.js` :**
    ```bash
    get_repo_raw_urls("https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch");
    ```
    Update the url with the desired github repository url. It will create a json file with the parsed URLs in the githubSources folder.

2. **Run the Python scripts:**
    ```bash
    python run_node.py
    ```
    This script will perform a specific task based on the configuration set in `index.js`. 

    ```bash
    python read_urls.py
    ```
    This script will read the URLs generated by the Node.js script and give a parseable json file in the appropriate githubSources/(name)/documentation folder

    ```bash
    python codeModel.py
    ```
    This script will update the json file generated in read_urls.py with the explanation for each function.
